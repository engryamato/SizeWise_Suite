Sophia’s Enhanced Kickoff Plan for SizeWise Suite1. What to Start: “Professional Engineering App Foundation”a. Version Control & Tooling (Day 1)Where: Project root (/app or /)• How:o git init (with remote set up on GitHub/GitLab)o npx create-react-app . --template typescript (or pnpm create vite for Vite if preferred)o yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixero npx tailwindcss init -po Set up .vscode/ for editor consistencyWhy:Lays a strong, standards-based foundation. TypeScript ensures type safety from day 1. Tailwind makes UI consistent and responsive.2. Where to Build: Core Structure & Scaffolding (Day 1-2)Where:The root /app or /src/ directory for source, /public/ for static files.How:CopyInsert this structure:/app├── .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml├── .vscode/settings.json├── public/├── src/│   ├── @types/│   ├── assets/│   ├── components/│   │   ├── layout/│   │   └── ui/│   ├── config/│   ├── features/│   │   └── tool-duct-sizer/│   ├── lib/│   ├── pages/│   ├── providers/│   ├── services/│   ├── stores/│   ├── test-utils/│   ├── utils/Why:This modular, feature-based structure ensures each new tool or feature (e.g., grease duct, gas vent) is self-contained and easily maintained. Shared components are never duplicated. Devs can jump in and work on features in parallel.3. How to Build: Development Workflow (Day 2-3)Where: Project root and /src/How:• Add Git hooks with Husky and lint-staged for auto-formatting/pre-commit checks• Configure ESLint + Prettier for code quality• Set up TypeScript strictness• Add a basic CI workflow (GitHub Actions) that runs tests and builds on each pushWhy:Catch bugs and style issues before they ship. CI ensures all PRs are tested before merging. Type safety and linting keep codebase clean.4. Core UI/UX & Design Tokens (Day 3-4)Where: /src/components/, /src/styles/How:• Implement design tokens (tokens.js) for colors, spacing, typography• Build core UI layouts (HeaderBar, SidebarNav, ResponsiveGrid)• Start with one tool: Duct Sizer (create /features/tool-duct-sizer/)Why:Tokens ensure consistent theming and easier rebranding or white-labeling later. Core layouts make adding more screens and tools fast.5. Performance and Modern Frontend (Day 4-5)Where: /src/features/, /src/components/How:• Implement code splitting (React.lazy, Suspense) so tools load only when used• Add image optimization components for assets and tool illustrationsWhy:Performance stays high, load times low—even as the app grows. Especially crucial for mobile or offline use.6. Testing & Quality Gates (Day 5-6)Where: /tests/, /src/features/tool-duct-sizer/__tests__/How:• Set up Jest (with jsdom) for unit/integration tests• Add a simple test for the first tool’s input panel (see provided DuctSizer.test.jsx)• Plan for visual regression and contract testsWhy:Prevents regression and ensures every field works as intended—critical for engineering calculations.7. Living Documentation & Stories (Day 6-7)Where: /docs/, .storybook/How:• Init Storybook for UI components (npx storybook init)• Write ADRs (Architecture Decision Records) for key choices• Document components with real engineering scenarios as storiesWhy:Easy for future devs (and field engineers!) to understand, test, and extend UI widgets and logic.8. CI/CD Deployment Pipeline (Day 7)Where: .github/workflows/ci-cd.ymlHow:• Pipeline runs tests, builds, deploys to GitHub Pages (or S3/Vercel/Netlify)• Production/staging branches for safe rolloutWhy:Every commit is auto-validated and ready for real-world use. Users can always access the latest working version.9.

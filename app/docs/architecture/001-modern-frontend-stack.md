# ADR 001: Modern Frontend Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
SizeWise Suite requires a modern, professional frontend stack that can:
- Handle complex engineering calculations in real-time
- Provide excellent user experience for HVAC professionals
- Support offline functionality for field use
- Scale to multiple tools and features
- Maintain high code quality and testability
- Deploy easily with CI/CD

## Decision
We will use the following frontend stack:

### Core Framework
- **React 18** with TypeScript for component-based architecture
- **Vite** as the build tool for fast development and optimized builds
- **React Router** for client-side routing

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling and consistency
- **Custom design tokens** for professional engineering aesthetic
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality and formatting
- **Husky + lint-staged** for pre-commit hooks

### Testing
- **Jest** with **jsdom** for unit and integration testing
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **@testing-library/user-event** for user interaction testing

### Build & Deployment
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment (with option to migrate to other platforms)

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents runtime errors and improves code quality
- **Performance**: Vite provides fast development builds and optimized production bundles
- **Developer Experience**: Modern tooling with hot reload, linting, and testing
- **Maintainability**: Component-based architecture makes code modular and reusable
- **Professional UI**: Tailwind enables consistent, responsive design
- **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive testing and linting catch issues early

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team members need familiarity with modern React patterns
- **Bundle Size**: Rich feature set may increase initial bundle size
- **Complexity**: More tools mean more configuration and potential points of failure

### Mitigation Strategies
- Code splitting with React.lazy() to reduce initial bundle size
- Comprehensive documentation and onboarding materials
- Gradual adoption of advanced features
- Regular dependency updates and security audits

## Implementation Notes
- All components follow TypeScript strict mode
- Tailwind configured with custom engineering color palette
- Jest configured for both unit and integration testing
- CI/CD pipeline runs tests, linting, and builds on every PR

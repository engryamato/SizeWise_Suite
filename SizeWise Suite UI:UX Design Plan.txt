SizeWise Suite – UI/UX Design Plan1. Core Design Principles• Professional Engineering Aesthetic: Clean, technical, and confidence-inspiring; similar to tools like Notion, Figma, or Autodesk but focused on clarity, function, and standards compliance.• Consistency Across All Tools: Unified header bar and layout across the suite, but each tool (DuctSizer, GreaseSizer, etc.) can have its own color theme or accent for fast recognition.• Real-Time Feedback: All calculations and validation results update instantly as the user inputs data.• Offline-First: UI/UX works seamlessly whether connected or not. No “loading” spinners except for user-initiated sync/export.• Accessibility: Color contrast, keyboard navigation, and font sizing must be compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA as minimum.2. Top-Level Navigation & Layout• Header Bar (Fixed on All Screens):o Left: Home (always visible)o Center (optional): Current tool name (e.g., DuctSizer)o Right: Light/Dark Mode toggle, Settings (gear icon)• Sidebar Navigation (for desktop/tablet):o Collapsible sidebar with quick links to all tools and moduleso Visible status icons for offline/online state• Mobile Responsiveness:o Header collapses into a hamburger menuo Key actions accessible with thumb reach (bottom nav or floating buttons)3. Per-Tool Workspace• Main Calculation Panel:o Left: Input form (sectioned with clear field groupings, e.g., “Dimensions,” “Airflow,” “Material,” etc.)o Right: Live Results Panel (updates in real time; shows outputs, warnings, and compliance flags)o Tooltips and references pop out for each field (SMACNA/NFPA rules accessible via small (i) icons)• Simulation Mode (Phase 2+):o Interactive canvas in main area, with drawing controls on left and simulation outputs (airflow lines, temp coloring, node results) on righto Live feedback as user draws/modifies ductwork4. Settings & Unit Controls• Settings Panel (Modal or Drawer):o Real-time unit switcher (SI/Imperial)—switch updates all fields/results instantlyo Theme selection, offline data management, export/import, and diagnostics• User Account/Profile (future):o Sync/export controls, usage history, subscription status5. Inline Validation & Compliance• Field-level validation:o Inline cues (e.g., red border for errors, orange for out-of-standard values)o Hover tooltips with guidance (from SMACNA/NFPA references)• Live Compliance Panel:o Visual checklist of standards compliance (e.g., “Duct gauge OK per SMACNA Table 5-1,” “Pressure drop exceeds recommended value!”)o Clickable warnings link directly to correction actions6. Documentation & Help• Quick Help:o Each screen/tool has a floating “?” or “Guide” button opening relevant docs from /docs/guides/ or /docs/tools/• Pop-up SMACNA/NFPA reference:o Legal/copyright-compliant, only showing small excerpts or links to full docs as allowed7. Modern Visuals & Feedback• Minimalist Cards, Soft Shadows, Rounded Corners (2xl), Generous Padding:o Clear card-based layout for inputs, outputs, and settings• Subtle Animation:o Framer Motion for panel transitions and simulation visuals (airflow, temperature gradients)• Status Badges & Progress Bars:o For calculations, sync, export, and validation pass/fail8. Accessibility & Usability• Font scaling for engineering readability (default: Inter, Roboto, or system font for /assets/fonts/)• High-contrast dark and light themes (fully switchable)• Tab/Enter keyboard flow optimized for speed entry (estimators can tab through forms rapidly)UI/UX Scaffolding Preview (CopyInsert Format)/app//   └── ui/        ├── components/        │   ├── HeaderBar.js        │   ├── SidebarNav.js        │   ├── ToolPanel.js        │   ├── ResultsPanel.js        │   ├── SimulationCanvas.js        │   ├── SettingsModal.js        │   ├── ValidationTooltip.js        │   └── ComplianceChecklist.js        ├── themes/        │   ├── light.js        │   └── dark.js        └── styles/            ├── base.css            └── tool-colors.css• HeaderBar.js: Fixed navigation, Home, Light/Dark, Settings• SidebarNav.js: Per-tool quick nav, status, online/offline• ToolPanel.js: Dynamic input fields, grouped by section• ResultsPanel.js: Live outputs, warnings, compliance• SimulationCanvas.js: Interactive drawing, real-time feedback• SettingsModal.js: Unit switch, theme, offline data, export/import• ValidationTooltip.js: SMACNA/NFPA rule popups• ComplianceChecklist.js: Visual pass/fail of all standards rulesImplementation Rationale• Why this layout?o Field engineers need to move fast: all tools accessible, inputs and results in one view, no hunting for data.o Modular components make it easy to add new tools or change UI per feedback.o Visual status and warnings mean fewer errors in the field, less rework.• Who benefits?o HVAC estimators, field engineers, project managers, and QA—all can use and trust the interface.• Testing Requirements:o All UI components must pass accessibility tests, visual regression snapshots, and cross-browser/device QA.• Versioning:o Major UI changes logged per semantic versioning; rollbackable via Git.• Dependencies:o Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React/Vue/Vanilla JS (project choice), Mocha/Jest for tests.Next Steps• Wireframe creation for all tool screens• UI component prototyping (Header, Inputs, Results, Simulation)• Design tokens and themes for consistency• Feedback loop with field users for iterative UI improvement

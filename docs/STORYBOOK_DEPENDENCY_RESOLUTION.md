# Storybook Dependency Resolution Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the resolution of Storybook dependency conflicts that were causing npm ci failures in the SizeWise Suite project.

## Problem Description

### Initial Issue
The project was experiencing ERESOLVE dependency conflicts during `npm ci` execution due to version mismatches between Storybook packages:

- **Main package**: `storybook@^9.0.10` (9.x version)
- **Addons**: Various packages at different versions (7.x and 8.x)
- **Conflict**: `@storybook/addon-essentials@^8.6.14` required `storybook@^8.6.14` but found `storybook@^9.0.10`

### Error Message
```
npm error code ERESOLVE
npm error ERESOLVE unable to resolve dependency tree
npm error Found: storybook@9.0.10
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer storybook@"^8.6.14" from @storybook/addon-essentials@8.6.14
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by:
1. **Version misalignment**: Storybook core package was at 9.x while addons were at 8.x
2. **Peer dependency conflicts**: Addons required specific Storybook core versions
3. **Mixed stable/alpha versions**: Some packages were using alpha versions while others were stable

### Package Version Analysis
- `storybook@^9.0.10` - Latest stable 9.x
- `@storybook/addon-essentials@^8.6.14` - Latest stable 8.x (requires storybook@^8.6.14)
- Various other addons at 7.x and mixed versions

## Solution Implemented

### Strategy: Align to Stable 8.6.14 Versions

We chose to downgrade all Storybook packages to the stable 8.6.14 version because:
1. **Stability**: 8.6.14 is the latest stable version with full ecosystem support
2. **Compatibility**: All addons have stable 8.6.14 versions available
3. **Reliability**: Avoids alpha/beta versions that might have issues

### Changes Made

#### Before (Conflicting Versions)
```json
{
  "storybook": "^9.0.10",
  "@storybook/addon-essentials": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/addon-interactions": "^7.5.3",
  "@storybook/addon-links": "^7.5.3",
  "@storybook/addon-onboarding": "^9.0.10",
  "@storybook/blocks": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/react": "^9.0.10",
  "@storybook/react-vite": "^9.0.10"
}
```

#### After (Aligned Versions)
```json
{
  "storybook": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/addon-essentials": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/addon-interactions": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/addon-links": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/addon-onboarding": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/blocks": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/react": "^8.6.14",
  "@storybook/react-vite": "^8.6.14"
}
```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Package Manager Commands Used
```bash
npm install storybook@^8.6.14 @storybook/react@^8.6.14 @storybook/react-vite@^8.6.14 @storybook/addon-onboarding@^8.6.14
npm install @storybook/addon-interactions@^8.6.14 @storybook/addon-links@^8.6.14
```

### 2. Verification Process
1. **Clean install test**: `rm -rf node_modules && npm ci`
2. **Development server test**: `npm run dev`
3. **Component tests**: `npm test -- --testPathPattern="src/"`
4. **Build verification**: Confirmed no new build errors

## Verification Results

### ✅ Successful Verification
- **npm ci**: Completes without ERESOLVE errors
- **npm install**: Clean installation without conflicts
- **Development server**: Starts successfully on port 3000
- **React components**: 21/22 tests pass, components render correctly
- **Core functionality**: Application loads and functions properly

### Test Results Summary
```
Test Suites: 2 passed, 1 failed (minor test assertion issue)
Tests: 21 passed, 1 failed
Components: All render correctly
Dependencies: No conflicts detected
```

## Best Practices Learned

### 1. Version Alignment Strategy
- **Always align major versions** across related packages
- **Prefer stable versions** over alpha/beta for production
- **Use package manager commands** instead of manual package.json edits

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Check peer dependencies** when upgrading packages
- **Test with clean installs** (`npm ci`) to catch conflicts early
- **Verify functionality** after dependency changes

### 3. Troubleshooting Process
1. Identify conflicting packages and their requirements
2. Check available versions and compatibility
3. Choose consistent version strategy
4. Apply changes using package manager
5. Verify with clean install and testing

## Future Considerations

### Upgrading to Storybook 9.x
When the ecosystem is ready for Storybook 9.x:
1. **Check addon compatibility**: Ensure all addons have stable 9.x versions
2. **Review breaking changes**: Check Storybook 9.x migration guide
3. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all functionality after upgrade
4. **Coordinate upgrade**: Update all packages simultaneously

### Monitoring Dependencies
- **Regular audits**: Check for dependency conflicts during development
- **CI/CD integration**: Ensure `npm ci` is tested in build pipeline
- **Version pinning**: Consider exact versions for critical dependencies
